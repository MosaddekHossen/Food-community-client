Client-side and about my project at least 5 bullet points
=========================================================
. User Authentication: This code provides user authentication capabilities, allowing users to create accounts, sign in with email and password, or sign in with their Google accounts.

. Firebase Integration: It integrates with Firebase Authentication, a widely used authentication service, to manage user accounts securely and store user credentials.

. Context-Based State Management: The code uses React's context API to manage the user's authentication state. This makes it simple to access user information and authentication functions throughout the application.

. User State Observer: It implements an observer to monitor the user's authentication state changes. This ensures that the application remains aware of whether a user is logged in or out and can respond accordingly.

. PropTypes Validation: The code includes PropTypes validation to ensure that the components receive the expected props, improving code reliability and debugging.
